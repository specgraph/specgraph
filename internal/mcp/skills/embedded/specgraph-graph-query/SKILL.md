# SpecGraph Graph Query

SpecGraph stores specs as graph nodes with first-class edges (dependencies,
blocks, compositions, decisions). This skill covers reading the graph: finding
specs, listing what's ready, walking dependencies, and impact analysis.

## When this skill applies

Trigger on questions like:

- "What specs are ready for me?"
- "What does X depend on?" / "What depends on X?"
- "Show me the graph" / "What's the impact of changing Y?"
- "List all specs" / "Find specs about Z"

## Tools and resources

| Intent | Use |
|---|---|
| List specs (with filters) | `spec` tool, `action: "list"` |
| Get a single spec | `spec` tool, `action: "get"`, with `slug` |
| Walk dependencies | `graph_query` tool, with `action: "deps"` or `"impact"` |
| Quick "what can I work on" | `specgraph://graph/ready` resource |
| Whole-graph view | `specgraph://graph` resource |
| Spec body and history | `specgraph://spec/<slug>` resource |

## Filters on `spec list`

The `spec` list action accepts:

- `stage` — filter by funnel stage (`spark`, `shape`, ..., `approved`, `done`)
- `domain` — filter by domain tag if the project uses domains
- `text_query` — substring match against intent and slug

Combine filters as needed. A typical "what's in flight" call is
`stage=specify,decompose,approved` plus the project's primary domain.

## Graph traversal

`graph_query` actions:

- `deps` — transitive dependencies of a slug (what it needs)
- `impact` — transitive dependents (what would be affected by change)
- `path` — shortest dependency path between two slugs

All traversals are bounded to 50 hops. Cycles are detected and reported.

## Resource cheat sheet

```text
specgraph://specs                   # list of all specs
specgraph://spec/{slug}             # one spec, full body
specgraph://spec/{slug}/changes     # change history
specgraph://decision/{slug}         # decision node
specgraph://constitution            # full constitution
specgraph://constitution/{layer}    # one layer (User/Org/Project/Domain)
specgraph://graph                   # graph summary
specgraph://graph/ready             # specs unblocked and ready
specgraph://findings                # all open findings
specgraph://prime                   # session-priming digest
```

## Don't

- Don't query the graph by reading raw storage paths. Use the MCP tools and
  resources; they enforce auth, edge semantics, and pagination.
- Don't infer "ready" from stage alone. A spec is ready when its dependencies
  are satisfied — `specgraph://graph/ready` does the math.
